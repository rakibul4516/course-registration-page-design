# Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.

In my project, I managed the state by keeping track of important information and data that the program needed to work correctly. Here's a simple explanation:

In my project, I used two types of states that is useState and useEffect.I used "useState" for a variable to store data and a function to set and update the variable data. I set an initial value that is a number or array."useEffect" is used to handle side effects.I used it for fetching data from JSON file. I Used dependencies empty array for the effect will only run once, right after the initial render. After declaring setState function I used the data on my project needs. I pass the data as props and receive from other components.Array function map used to get single data. It was process to use states in my project.
