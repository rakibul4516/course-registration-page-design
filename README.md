# Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.

In my project, I managed the state by keeping track of important information and data that the program needed to work correctly. Here's a simple explanation:

In my project, I used two types of states that is useState and useEffect."useState" takes one variable to store data and a function to set and update the variable data. We can set an initial value that can be a number or array."useEffect" is used to handle side effects such as fetching data from API, DOM manipulation, or subscribing. dependencies are an important concept that determines when the effect should be executed. Dependencies are an array of values that we pass as the second argument to "useEffect". The effect will run whenever any of the values in the dependencies array change between renders.
